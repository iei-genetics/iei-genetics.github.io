    "content": "We transform the raw IUIS IEI data into a searchable, human- and machine-readable table with enhanced functionality. Our cleaning process integrates links to OMIM, expanded HPO terms, and standardises gene names to HUGO symbols. Specifically, we: . | Measure the distribution of data across major categories and subcategories to ensure even representation for robust classification (see Figure plot_patch2.pdf). | Remove extraneous whitespace and ambiguous characters to improve clarity. | Merge multiple HPO columns into a single “HPO combined” field and expand these into individual HPO terms with corresponding definitions. | Standardise gene names to single HUGO symbols (e.g. converting “CD40 (TNFRSF5)” to “CD40”) and split entries with multiple genes into separate rows. | Streamline inheritance classifications for consistency. | Recategorise free-text descriptions of cell and immunoglobulin counts into concise, uniform labels (e.g. “normal”, “low”, “borderline”, “defective”), with before-and-after label distributions illustrated in Figures plot_patch1.pdf and plot_patch3.pdf. | . This comprehensive cleaning ensures the final IEI table is easy to navigate, supports advanced queries, and reliably links to external resources. ",
